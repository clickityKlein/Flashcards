meant to be a virtual replacement to physical flashcards, and features abilities
such as deck combination and shuffling.

## Project Motivation
The goal of this project was to create an object based virtual flashcards program
that could replace physical flashcards. Besides general testing, there are three
phases:

1. Create a class based program that works in an IDE
2. Create csv libraries for the desired flashcards
3. Create an application outside an IDE

It was imperative to include the SymPy library, as this will personally be used heavily for
mathematical concepts. On another personal note, further motivation for developing this
into some sort of application was to swap mindless scrolling with learning during downtime.
