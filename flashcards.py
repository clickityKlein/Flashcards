"""
This is a flashcard based object program.

Object: Flashcard
Each Flashcard object will have the following attributes:
    - question
    - answer
    - set (to designate subject matter, subset of subject matter)
    - number (used for place in set, randomization,
              arbitrary unless order matters)
    - status (pass, maybe, fail)
Each Flashcard object will have the following methods:
    - flip_card
    - alter_status
    

Object: Deck
Each Deck object will have the following attributes:
    - name
    - total_collection (collection of Card objects)
    - sets (list of all sets)
    - pass_collection (collection of Card objects set to pass)
    - maybe_collection (collection of Card objects set to maybe)
    - fail_collection (collection of Card objects set to fail)
    - misc_collection (collection of Card objects set to miscellaneous)?
    
Each Deck object will have the following methods:
    - total_cards (number of total cards, number of total cards)
    - name_sets (display what sets are in collection, and number of cards)
    - shuffle_collection (shuffles a given collection)
    - reorder_collection (orders the cards by set and then increasing numerical order)
    - add_to_deck (adds Card or other Deck to this Deck)
    - quiz (flips through specified set or collection)
    - reset_collection (resets specified collection)
    - alter_collection (manually alter specified collection)
    - delete_card (deletes a single specified card out of total_collection)
    - delete_set (deletes specified set(s) out of total_collection)
    

The intermediate plan is to make the idea work and look into the application
transfer process at a later time.

The ultimate plan is to replace paper flashcards in an application that can be
accessed by mobile devices, with the goal of replacing endless scrolling with
a session of flashcarding.
