"""
This is a flashcard based object program.

Object: Flashcard
Each Flashcard object will have the following attributes:
    - question
    - answer
    - subset (to designate subject matter, subset of subject matter)
    - number (used for place in set, randomization,
              arbitrary unless order matters)
    - status (pass, maybe, fail)
    
Each Flashcard object will have the following methods:
    - flip_card (reveals answer, asks user to input score)
    

Object: Deck
Each Deck object will have the following attributes:
    - name
    - total_collection (collection of Card objects)
    - sets (list of all sets)
    - pass_collection (collection of Card objects set to pass)
    - maybe_collection (collection of Card objects set to maybe)
    - fail_collection (collection of Card objects set to fail)
    - set_collection (collection of Card objects belonging to a single subset)
    
Each Deck object will have the following methods:
    - add_to_deck (adds Card or other Deck to this Deck)
    - deck_to_df (converts the Deck into a DataFrame)
    - total_cards (number of total cards)
    - get_sets (returns a list of all unique sets in the deck)
    - total_sets (number of total sets)
    - name_sets (display what sets are in collection, and number of cards)
    - score_collection (assign cards to proper scoring collection)
    - quiz (flips through specified set or collection)
    - single_set (fills set_collection with a single specified subset)
    - shuffle_collection (shuffles a given collection)
    - delete_set (deletes specified set(s) out of total_collection)
    - reorder_collection (orders the cards by set and then increasing numerical order)
    - delete_card (deletes a single specified card out of total_collection)
    - reset_deck (empties all of the list attributes)
    - import_csv (fills a Deck object with Card objects made from csv file rows)
    - export_csv (exports a Deck object as a csv file)
    

The intermediate plan is to make the idea work and look into the application
transfer process at a later time.
